1. What is the difference between a Programming Language and a Scripting Language?
Ans. 
Programming Languages:
 i) A programming language is a formal language that is used to write instructions that can be executed by a computer.
 ii) Source code is compiled into machine code before execution.
 iii) Typically have a stricter, static type system.
 iv) Tend to have more complex control structures, like loops and conditionals.
 v) Tend to have more complex control structures, like loops and conditionals.
 vi) Often used for developing large, complex applications.
 vii) Examples: C++, Java, Python, Ruby, Swift.

 Scripting Language:
 i) A scripting language is a type of programming language that is used to write scripts, which are sets of instructions that are executed by an interpreter rather than being compiled into an executable program.
 ii) Code is interpreted at runtime without a separate compilation step.
 iii) Usually have a more flexible, dynamic type of system.
 iv) Usually have simpler control structures that are optimized for ease of use.
 v) Typically slower, as they are interpreted at runtime.
 vi) Typically used for smaller, simpler tasks or automating system tasks.
 vii) Examples: Bash, JavaScript, PHP, Perl,

 2. What is an algorithm? Can you give an example of a simple algorithm?
 Ans. An algorithm is a set of well-defined steps or instructions that can be followed to solve a problem or accomplish a task. Algorithms are an essential part of computer science and are used in a wide range of applications, including data processing, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.
 An algorithm should have the following properties:

i) Input: An algorithm should take one or more inputs as input.
ii) Output: An algorithm should produce one or more outputs as a result of the input.
iii) Definiteness: An algorithm should have a clear and precise set of steps that can be followed in a specific order.
iv) Finiteness: An algorithm should have a finite number of steps and should terminate after a certain point.
v) Effectiveness: An algorithm should be able to solve a problem or accomplish a task in a reasonable amount of time.
